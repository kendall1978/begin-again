                use disorders and related issues and need assistance to break free from its devastating effects.
                Our program consists of a 90 day non-medical in-house program. We provide nonjudgement, trauma informed care
                that creates a healing environment that assists women in their goal to remain free of substance use. We believe
                personal commitment combined with the right place and the right help is key to
                success. We provide additional resources and transportation to other programs when needed.
